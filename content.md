# Ideas Tool: Copilot

The previous [guide for ideas.firstdraft](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/233-ideas-tool) ignored one crucial feature of the tool that you weren't ready to learn yet: **Copilot**.

Now that you know about [`draft:resource` generators](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/133-draft-resource-generator), `has_many` and `belongs_to` [association accessor methods](https://association-accessors.firstdraft.com/), and [sign-in/sign-out](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/238-authentication-with-devise-basics), you're ready to use this powerful tool to automate a huge amount of code writing!

Visit [ideas.firstdraft.com](https://ideas.firstdraft.com/), and open one of your projects to get started.

Once you have a project open, note the "Copilot" button

{: .bleed-full }

Once you click that you should see a new page where the commands to `rails generate` user accounts and resources, and the association accessor methods that you can add in your models!

Feel free to use as many of those commands as you want to build your app, but **you should not be afraid to change the generated code**.
